# Pinnacle Plus is Now Live!

Around 30% of underrepresented communities, such as people of color, latinoX, LGBTQ+, and younger generations, leave their jobs due to a lack of health benefits.

KPMG can offer Pinnacle Plus to employees and partners, which is the turnkey solution for 24 hour communication service with virtual access to healthcare providers, industry partners, and government assistance programs.

KPMG will be able to outreach to other internal programs and companies in the application on behalf of the employee, since Pinnacle Plus offers a partnership portal. Individual companies who are already a partner will have their own login on the site in order to add more funds or send a request for future collaborations.

# In the Zip file solution, you will find the following:

- An executive summary of the entire project and program concept that we have created
- A powerpoint presentation that you can view to see the potetial we had in mind for the entirety of the website

# Getting Started with Pinnacle Plus

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
